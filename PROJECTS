			    THE R PROJECT LIST

		      Dream, dream, dream ...
				- The Everly Brothers


Here is a list of projects which we think could enhance R substantially.
Some of these we re thinking about doing ourselves, but others could be
taken on by anyone.


 o  DOCUMENTATION
    Switch to a comletely SGML based set of documentation, with ways of
    producing HTML, LaTeX and Plain Text.  On Windows and the Mac use
    HTML to provide a manual.


 o  WINDOWS 3/95/NT PORT.
    Robert has this in hand and is nearly done.


 o  POWER MACINTOSH PORT.
    This is temporarily on hold, pending funding or Ross having some
    free time.  [ We have to do this.  Our teaching labs are Mac based. ]


 o  LIBRARY STRUCTURE
    We need a way to "attach" libraries.  This should happen in
    conjunction with "save" and "load", and with some sort of hashing
    to speedup lookups in libraries.


 o  MULTIPLE ACTIVE DEVICE DRIVERS.
    The basics of this is actually pretty simple to implement.  The
    hard part is thinking about how to manage display lists.  It would
    be nice to have a choice of "in-memory" or "disk-based" display-list
    storage.


 o  MATHEMATICS IN PLOT LABELS
    We have an expression parser and can grab parse trees.  All we
    need is access to font metrics for bounding boxes (done now) and
    some time to plow through a couple of appendices of the TeX Book.
    [ Ross and Paul Murrell are working on this ... ]


 o  DYNAMIC GRAPHICS
    Statistics for the video game generation ...
    We need to move to an event-based model for this.
    X3d looks like it would be worth a look.  It provides very fast
    response for complex wireframe structures.
    XGobi is nice too.


 o  LINEAR MODELLING
    The whole "glm" suite needs to be rethought and redone.
    We need "aov" and friends (pretty easy given what we have).
    Labelling for nested specifications needs to be handled correctly.
    Additional functionality (drop1, update ...).


 o  NONLINEAR MODELLING
    Was that Doug Bates I heard rustling about over there in the
    corner ... :-)


 o  GAM MODELS
    The basic code is at STATLIB.  Did Trevor Hastie put out an
    update to this?


 o  LOESS MODELS
    The code is at NETLIB.


 o  RECURSIVE PARTITIONING
    There is some very nice looking code by Terry Therneau at STATLIB.


 o  TIME SERIES
    A state-space/structural models package would be nice.
    We have a partial spectrum analysis package.  It needs to be
    mutivariate though.
