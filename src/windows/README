To create a version of R that can be compiled under windows (starting in Unix)
follow the following instructions:

	o make distclean in the R directory.

	o run configure.win.

	o copy to the Windows machine the R/src directories: 
		- include
		- appl
		- graphics
		- main
		- math
		- windows

	o copy the R directories:
		- demos
		- library


Then create a project in your favorite compiler/ide (mine's watcom these days)
