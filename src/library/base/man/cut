ALIAS(cut)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(x@@ a numeric vector which is to be converted to a factor by cutting).
ARG(break @@ either a vector of cut points or number
giving the number of intervals which LANG(x) is to be
cut into.)
ARG(labels @@ labels for the levels of the resulting category).
)
VALUE(
LANG(cut) divides the range of LANG(x) into intervals
and codes the values in LANG(x) according to which
interval they fall.
The leftmost interval corresponds to level one,
the next leftmost to level two and so on.
If a LANG(labels) parameter is specified, its values are used
to name the factor levels. If none is specified, the factor
level labels are taken to be LANG("Range 1"), LANG("Range 2"),
etc.
