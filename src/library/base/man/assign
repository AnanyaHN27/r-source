assign(x, value, pos=-1, envir=sys.frame(sys.parent()),
        inherits=FALSE, immediate=TRUE)
)
ALIAS(assign)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(x @@ a variable name (given as a quoted string).)
ARG(value @@ a value to be assigned to LANG(x).)
ARG(envir @@ the environent in which to assign. The default is the
environment where the call to LANG(assign) takes place.)
ARG(inherits @@ should the enclosing frames of the environment be inspected.)
ARG(immediate @@ an ignored compatibility feature.)
)
VALUE(
This function is invoked for its side effect, which is
assign LANG(value) to the variable LANG(x).  If no LANG(envir)
is specified, then the assignment takes place in the
currently active environment.
PARA
If LANG(inherits) is LANG(TRUE) then parents of the supplied
environment are searched until the variable LANG(x) is encountered.
The value is then assigned in the environment in which the variable
is encountered.  If the symbol is not encountered then assignment
takes place in the global environment.
PARA
If LANG(inherits) is LANG(FALSE) then assigment takes place in 
the initial frame of LANG(envir).
