TITLE(plot.xy @@ Extracting Plotting Structures)
USAGE(
plot.xy(x, y, xlab=NULL, ylab=NULL)
)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(x,y @@ the coordinates of points in the plot.
Alternatively, a single argument LANG(x) can be be provided.
In this case, an attempt is made to interpret the
argument in a way suitable for plotting.
If the argument is a list containing components LANG(x) and
LANG(y), these are used are assumed to define plotting coordinates;
if the argument contains a time series, the x values are
taken to be time and the y values to be the time series;
if the argument is a matrix with two columns, the first
is assumed to contain the x values and the second the
y values; in any other case, the argument is coerced to a vector
and the values plotted against their indices.
)
ARG(xlab,ylab @@ names for the x and y variables to be extracted.)
)
DESCRIPTION(
LANG(plot.xy) is used by many function to obtain
x and y coordinates for plotting.
The use of this common mechanism across all R functions
produces a measure of consistency.
PARA
LANG(plot) and LANG(lowess) are examples of functions
which use this mechanism.
