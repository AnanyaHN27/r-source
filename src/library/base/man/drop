TITLE(drop @@ Drop Redundant Extent Information)
USAGE(
drop(x)
)
ALIAS(drop)
VALUE(
If LANG(x) is an object with a LANG(dim) attribute
(e.g. a matrix or array), then LANG(drop), returns
an object like LANG(x), but with any extents of length
one removed.  Any accompanying LANG(dimnames) attribute
is adjusted and returned with LANG(x).
PARA
Array subsetting typically performs this reduction,
but sometimes it is useful to invoke LANG(drop) directly.
