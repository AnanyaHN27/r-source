chisquare.test(x, y=NULL, correct=T,
        p=rep(1/length(x),length(x)))
)
ALIAS(chisquare.test)
DESCRIPTION(
This function performs a chisquare test on the
contingency table in the object LANG(x) and
returns the results of the test.
If LANG(x) is a vector or a matrix with one row or column
and LANG(y) has no argument then the table is assumed to be
one-dimensional, and the chisquare test for a specific set of
population probabilities is performed.
These are in the vector LANG(p), or, if LANG(p) is missing,
are assumed to be equal.
If LANG(x) is a matrix with two or more rows and
two or more columns or LANG(x) and LANG(y) are vectors or 
factors specifying a two-way contingency table with two or
more rows and two or more columns then a chisquare test
for independence or equal group probabilities is
performed.
If LANG(correct=TRUE) then Yates' continuity correction is
applied to 2 by 2 tables.
)
VALUES(
The function prints out the result of the test and returns a
list containing the following elements: @@
ARG(chi @@ the matrix containing the components of chi-square.)
ARG(E @@ the matrix containing the expected values.)
