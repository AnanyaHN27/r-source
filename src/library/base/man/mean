TITLE(mean @@ Arithmetic Mean)
USAGE(
mean(x, trim=0, na.rm=FALSE)
)
ALIAS(mean)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(x @@ a numeric vector containing the values
whose mean is to be computed.)
ARG(trim @@ the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be
trimmed from each end of LANG(x) before the mean is computed.)
ARG(na.rm @@ a logical value indicating whether LANG(NA)
values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.)
)
DESCRIPTION(
If LANG(trim) is zero (the default),
the arithmetic mean of the values in LANG(x) is computed.
If LANG(trim) is non-zero, a symmetrically trimmed mean is computed
with a fraction of LANG(trim) observations deleted from each end
before the mean is computed.
PARA
Missing values are ignored.
