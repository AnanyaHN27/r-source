ALIAS(par)
DESCRIPTION(
COMMENT(LANG(par) is an abomination before man and god.)
LANG(par) can be used to set or query graphical parameters.
Parameters can be set by specifying them as arguments to LANG(par")
in LANG(tag=value) form, or by passing them as a list of tagged values.
In either case the previous values are returned in an invisible tagged list.
Such a list can be passed as an arument to LANG(par) to
restore the parameter values.
PARA
Parameters are queried by giving vectors of character strings to
LANG(par).  In this case, the values are returned in a tagged list.

BEGIN_ARGUMENTS
ARG(adj @@
The value of LANG(adj) determines the way in which text strings are justified.
A value of LANG(0) produces right left-justified text, LANG(0.5)
centered text and LANG(1) right-justified text.)

not annotate the plots they produce with axis and overall
titles.
The default is to do annotation.)

A description of how colors are specified is given below.)

about plots.  If LANG(bty) is one of are LANG("o"), LANG("l"), LANG("7") or
LANG("c") the resulting box resembles the corresponding upper case letter.
A value of LANG("n") suppresses the box.)

END_ARGUMENTS
SECTION(Color Specification @@
Colors can be specified in several different ways.  The simplest way is
with a character string giving the color name (eg. LANG("red")).
A list of the possible colors can be obtained with the function
LANG(LINK(colors)).  Alternatively, colors can be specified directly
in terms of there RGB components with a string of the form
LANG("#RRGGBB") where each of the pairs LANG(RR), LANG(GG),
LANG(BB) consist of two hexidecimal digits giving a value in the
range LANG(00) to LANG(FF).  Colors can also be specified
by giving an index into a small table of colors.  This provides
compatibility with S.
PARA
The functions LANG(rgb), LANG(hsv), LANG(gray) and LANG(rainbow)
provide additional ways of generating colors.
)
SECTION(Line Type Specification @@
Line types can either be specified by giving an index
into a small built in table of line types (1=solid, 2=dashed, 3=dotted)
or directly as the lengths of on/off stretches of line.
This is done with a string of up to eight characters which give
the lengths in consecutive positions in the string.
For example, the string LANG("33") specifies three pixels on followed
by three off and LANG("3313") specifies three pixels on followed
by three off followed by one on and finally three off.
