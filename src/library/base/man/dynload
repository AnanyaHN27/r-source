TITLE(dyn.load @@ Link to a DLL)
USAGE(
dyn.load(libname)
)
ALIAS(dyn.load)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(libname @@
a character string giving the pathname to a DLL.)
)
VALUE(
This function is used for its side effect which
links the specified shared library to the executing R image.
Calls to LANG(.C) and LANG(.Fortran) can then be used to execute
C functions or Fortran subroutines contained in the library.
PARA
The creation of shared libraries the runtime linking
of them into executing programs is very platform
dependent.  In recent years there has been some
simplification in the process because the C subroutine
call LANG(dlopen) has become the standard for doing this
under Unix.
LANG(dyn.load) uses the LANG(dlopen) mechanism and
should work on all platforms which support it.
)
NOTE(
The original code for loading DLLs in UNIX
was provided by Heiner Schwarte.
The compatibility code for HP-UX was provided by Luke Tierney.
