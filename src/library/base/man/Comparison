VALUE(
These binary operators allow the comparison of values in vectors.
They return a vector of logicals indicating the result of the
element by element comparison.  The elements of shorter vectors
are recycled as necessary.
PARA
Objects such as arrays or time-series can be compared this
way provided they are conformable.
