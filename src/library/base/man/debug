TITLE(debug @@ Debug a function )
USAGE(
debug(fun)
undebug(fun)
)
ALIAS(debug)
ALIAS(undebug)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(fun @@ any interpreted R function.)
)
DESCRIPTION(
These functions set and unset the debugging flag on a function.
When a function flagged for debugging is entered, normal execution
is suspended and the body of function is executed on statement at a time.
A new browser context is initiated for each step (and the previous one
destroyed).
Currently you can only debug functions that have bodies enclosed in braces.
This is a bug and will be fixed soon.
You take the next step by typing carriage return, LANG(n) or LANG(next).
You can see the values of variables by typing their names.
Typing LANG(c) or LANG(cont) causes the debugger to continue to the
end of the function.
You can LANG(debug) new functions before you step in to them from inside
the debugger.
If you have variables with names that are identical to the controls
(eg. LANG(c) or LANG(n) ) then you need to use LANG(print(c)) and
LANG(print(n)) to evaluate them.
