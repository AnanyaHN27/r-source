VALUE(
The function LANG(factor) is used to encode a vector as a factor
(the names category and enumerated type are also used for factors).
If LANG(ordered) is LANG(TRUE), the factor levels are assumed ordered.
By default the levels are unordered.
For compatibility purposes, there is also a function called
LANG(ordered) which provides an alternative way of creating
ordered factors.
PARA
The encoding of the vector happens as follows: if LANG(x[i]==levels[j])
then the LANG(i)-th element of the result is LANG(j).
If no match is found for LANG(x[i]) in LANG(levels), then the
LANG(i)-th element of the result is set to LANG(NA).
Any values listed in LANG(exclude) result in LANG(NA)s
appearinging in the returned factor.
If LANG(exclude) is set to a zero length vector, then any
LANG(NA) values in LANG(x) are used for form a new level
for the factor.
ITALIC(This means that there will be no) LANG(NA)
ITALIC(values in the result).
PARA
LANG(labels) is a vector of character strings used to label
the levels of the factor.
The default is to use the encoded factor levels.
PARA
LANG(is.factor) returns LANG(TRUE) or LANG(FALSE)
depending on whether its argument is of type factor or not.
Correspondingly, LANG(is.ordered) (LANG(is.unordered))
returns LANG(TRUE) when its argument is ordered (unordered)
and LANG(FALSE) otherwise.
PARA
LANG(as.factor) coerces its argument to a factor.
It is an abbreviated form of LANG(factor).
