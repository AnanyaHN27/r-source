TITLE(delay @@ Delay Evaluation)
USAGE(
delay(expr, env=.GlobalEnv)
)
ALIAS(delay)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(expr @@ an expression.)
ARG(env @@ an evaluation environment)
)
DESCRIPTION(
LANG(delay) creates a ITALIC(promise) to evaluate the given
expression in the specifies environment if its value is requested.
This provides direct access to ITALIC(lazy evaluation) mechanism
used by R for the evaluation of (interpreted) functions.
PARA
This is an experimental feature and its addition is purely
for evaluation purposes.
)
VALUE(
A ITALIC(promise) to evaluate the expression.
The value which is retuned by LANG(delay) can be assigned
without forcing its evaluation, but any further accesses
will cause evaluation.
)
EXAMPLES(
x <- delay({
    for(i in 1:10)
        print("yippee!\n")
    10
})
)
