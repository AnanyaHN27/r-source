DESCRIPTION(
This command starts the graphics device driver for the Macintosh.
This is usually done automagically at start up time
and can only be done on a Macintosh.
PARA
Selecting LANG(Print) from the file menu when the graphics
window is active will spool the graph to the printer,
however,
it is usually more effective to use LANG(Copy) to copy
the graph to the scrap for pasting directly into
a Macintosh application such as ITALIC(WriteNow) or ITALIC(Word).
