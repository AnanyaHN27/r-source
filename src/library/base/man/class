DESCRIPTION(
R possesses a simple generic function mechanism
which can be used for an object-oriented style of programming.
Method despatch takes place based on the class of the first argument
to the generic function.
PARA
An R ``object'' is a data object which has a LANG(class) attribute.
A class attribute is a vector of character strings giving the
names of the classes which the object ``inherits'' from.
When a generic function LANG(fun) is applied to an object 
with class attribute c("first","second"), the system searches
for a function called LANG(fun.first) and, if it finds it,
applied it to the object.  If no such function is found
a function called LANG(fun.second) is tried.
If no class name produces a suitable function, the function
LANG(fun.default) is used.
PARA
The function LANG(class) prints the vector of names of classes
which an object inherits from.
Correspondingly, LANG(class<-) sets the classes
which an object inherits from.
LANG(unclass) returns (a copy of) its argument
with its class information removed.
LANG(inherits) indicates whether its first argument inherits
from a class with name equal to its second argument.
