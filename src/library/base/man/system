LANG(system) invokes the system command specified by LANG(command).
If LANG(intern) is LANG(TRUE) then popen is used to invoke the
command and the output collected, line by line, into an R string
vector which is returned as the value of LANG(system).  If LANG(intern)
is LANG(FALSE) then the C function LANG(system) is used to invoke
the command and the value returned by LANG(system) is the exit
status of this function.  This function provides users with
the ability to invoke system commands on whatever platform they
are using.
