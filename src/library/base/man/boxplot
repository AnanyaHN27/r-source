TITLE(boxplot @@ Box Plots)
USAGE(
boxplot(DOTS, range=1.5, width, varwidth=FALSE,
        notch=FALSE, names, data, plot=TRUE, col=NULL,
        border=par("fg"))
)
ALIAS(boxplot)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(DOTS @@ the data from which the boxplots are to be produced.
The data can be specified as separate vectors, each corresponding
to a component boxplot, or as a single list containing such vectors.
Alternatively a symbolic specification of the form
LANG(x ~ g) can be given, indicating the the observations
in the vector LANG(x) are to be grouped according to
the levels of the factor LANG(g).  In this case the argument
LANG(data) can be used to provide values for the variables
in the specification.
LANG(NA)s are allowed in the data.
)
ARG(range @@ this determines how far the plot whiskers
extend out from the box.
If LANG(range) is positive, 
the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which
is no more than LANG(range) times the interquartile range
from the box.
A value of zero causes the whiskers to extend to the data extremes.)
ARG(width @@ a vector giving the relative widths of the boxes
making up the plot.)
ARG(varwidth @@ if LANG(varwidth) is LANG(TRUE), the boxes
are drawn with widths proportional to the square-roots
of the number of observations in the groups.)
ARG(notch @@ if LANG(notch) is LANG(TRUE), a notch is drawn in each
side of the boxes.  If the notches of two plots do not
overlap then the medians are significantly different at the
5 percent level.)
ARG(name @@ group labels which while be printed under
each boxplot.)
ARG(plot @@ if LANG(plot) is LANG(TRUE) (the default) then
a boxplot is produced.
If not, the summaries which the boxplots are based on are
returned.)
ARG(border @@ an optional vector of colors for the outlines of
the boxplots.  The values in LANG(border) are recycled if
the length of LANG(border) is less than the number of plots.)
ARG(col @@ if LANG(col) is non-null it is assumed to
contain colors to be used to col the bodies of the box plots.)
ARG(DOTS @@ graphical parameters can also be passed as
arguments to LANG(boxplot).)
)
VALUES(
This function is usually invoked for its side effect
which is to produce box-and-whisker plots of the given values.
However, it also returns a list with one component corresponding
to each plot.  The components are themselves lists with named components
as follows: @@
ARG(stats @@ a vector containing the extreme of the
lower whisker, the lower hinge, the median, the upper hinge
and the extreme of the upper whisker.)
ARG(n @@ the number of observations in the sample.)
ARG(conf @@ the lower and upper extremes of the notch.)
ARG(out @@ the values of any data points which lie beyond the
extremes of the whiskers.)
)
SEEALSO(
LANG(LINK(boxplot.stats)) which does the computation and
LANG(LINK(bxp)) for the plotting.
