ARGUMENTS(
ARG(topic, name @@ A name or character string on which documentation is
desired.)
ARG(data  @@ A name or character string specifying a data set on which
information is sought.)
ARG(package @@ A name or character vector giving the packages to look
into for documentation.  By default, all packages in the search path are
used.)
ARG(lib.loc @@ A character vector of directory names of R libraries.
Defaults to all libraries currently known.)

DESCRIPTION(
These functions provide online access to documentation. 
Documentation on an R entity function with name LANG(name) can be
printed on-screen with either LANG(help(name)) or LANG(?name).
In the case of unary and binary operators and control-flow special
forms, the name may need to be be quoted.
PARA
LANG(?data(name)) provides information on the (first) data set named
LANG(name).  Additional arguments may be given to request specific
information.  E.g., LANG(?data(name, package = PKG)) only looks for
documentation on data set name in the packages specified by LANG(PKG).
PARA
LANG(?package(name)) displays information on package LANG(name),
typically by listing the most important user-level R objects it
contains.  Equivalently, one could use LANG(library(help = name)).
PARA
LANG(?library(lib.loc)) informs about the libraries specified by
LANG(lib.loc), usually giving their location and the list of packages
available in them.  Use LANG(library()) to obtain a list of all
available packages.
PARA
One can abbreviate the forms for obtaining information on data sets,
packages and libraries, see the examples below.
