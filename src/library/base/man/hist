)
ALIAS(hist)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(x @@ a vector of values for which the histogram is desired.)
ARG(breaks @@ either a single number giving the
approximate number of cells for the histogram
or a vector giving the breakpoints between histogram cells.)
ARG(freq @@ a logical vector which indicates whether the
histogram is to present a representation of frequencies
