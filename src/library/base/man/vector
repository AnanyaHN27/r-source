USAGE(
vector(type="logical", length=0)
as.vector(x,mode="any")
is.vector(x)
)

DESCRIPTION(
LANG(vector) produces a vector of the given length and type.
Logical vector elements are initialized to
LANG(FALSE), numeric vector elements to LANG(0)
and character vector elements to LANG("").
PARA
LANG(as.vector) attempts to coerce its argument
into a vector of mode LANG(mode)
(the default is to coerce to whichever mode is most convenient).
The attributes of LANG(x) are removed.
PARA
LANG(is.vector) returns LANG(TRUE) if LANG(x)
is a vector (of mode logical, factor, integer, real or character) and
LANG(FALSE) otherwise.
