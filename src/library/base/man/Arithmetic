VALUE(
These binary operators perform arithmetic on vector objects.
They return numeric vectors containing the result of the element
by element operations.  The elements of shorter vectors are recycled
as necessary.  The operators are LANG(+) for addition, LANG(-) for
subtraction LANG(*) for multiplication, LANG(/) for division and
LANG(^) for exponentiation.
LANG(%%) indicates LANG(x mod y) and LANG(%/%) indicates integer
division.
PARA
Objects such as arrays or time-series can be operated on this
way provided they are conformable.
