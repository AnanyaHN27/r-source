TITLE(barplot @@ Barplots)
USAGE(
barplot(height, names.arg, col, border=par("fg"),
        beside=FALSE, space=0.2, legend.text,
        main=NULL, xlab=NULL, ylab=NULL,
        xlim, ylim)
)
ALIAS(barplot)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(height @@ either a vector or matrix of values descibing the
the bars which make up the plot.  If LANG(height) is a vector,
the plot consists of a sequence of rectangular bars with heights
given by the values in the vector.
If LANG(height) is a matrix and LANG(beside) is LANG(FALSE)
then each bar of the plot corresponds to a column of
LANG(height), with the values in the column giving the
heights of stacked ``sub-bars'' making up the bar.
If LANG(height) is a matrix and LANG(beside) is LANG(TRUE),
then the values in each column are juxtaposed rather than
stacked.)
ARG(names.arg @@ a vector of names to be plotted below each
bar or group of bars.  If this argument is omitted, then
the names are taken from the LANG(names) attribute of LANG(height)
if LANG(height) is a vector, or the column names of LANG(height) if
LANG(height) is a matrix.)
ARG(col @@ a vector of colors for the bars or bar components.)
ARG(border @@ The color to be used for the border of the bars.)
ARG(beside @@ a logical value.  If LANG(FALSE), the columns of
LANG(height) are portrayed as stacked bars, and if LANG(TRUE)
the columns are portrayed as juxtaposed bars.)
ARG(space @@ the relative amount of space between the bars or
groups of bars. The width of a bar (or group of bars) plus the
value of LANG(space) is one.)
ARG(legend.text @@ a vector of text used to construct a legend
for the plot.  This is only useful when LANG(height) is a matrix.
In that case the legend labels should correspond to the rows
of LANG(height).)
ARG(main @@ an overall title for the plot.)
ARG(xlab @@ a label for the x axis.)
ARG(ylab @@ a label for the y axis.)
ARG(xlim @@ limits for the x axis.)
ARG(ylim @@ limits for the y axis.)
)
VALUE(
This function is invoked for its side effect of producing
a barplot in the graphics window.
It returns no useful value.
