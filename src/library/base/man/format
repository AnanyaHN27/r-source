VALUE(
This function converts its first argument to a vector of character strings,
which have a common format (as is done by print).
If LANG(trim) is LANG(TRUE), leading blanks are trimmed off the
strings.
This is useful when the strings are to be used for plot axis annotation.
PARA
The function LANG(formatC) provides a rather more flexible
formatting facility.
