TITLE(curve @@ Draw Function Plots)
USAGE(
curve(expr, from, to, n=100, DOTS)
)
ALIAS(curve)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(expr @@ an expression, written as a function of
LANG(x) which will be plotted.)
ARG(from,to @@ the range over which the function will be plotted.)
ARG(n @@ the expression will be evaluated at LANG(n)
points equally spaced over the range LANG([from, to]).
The points determined in this way are then joined with
straight lines.)
ARG(DOTS @@ graphical parameters can also be specified as arguments.)
)
VALUE(
This function draws a curve corresponding to the
given expression (in LANG(x)) over the interval
LANG([from,to]).
It is a quick hack which seems to serve a useful purpose,
but can give bad results for functions which are
discontinuous.
)
EXAMPLES(
curve(x^3-3*x, -2, 2)
