TITLE(bxp @@ Box Plots from Summaries)
USAGE(
bxp(z, width, varwidth=FALSE, notch=FALSE, DOTS)
)
ALIAS(bxp)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(z @@ a list containing data summaries to
be used in constructing the plots.
These are usually the result of a call to LANG(boxplot),
but can be generated in any fashion.)
ARG(width @@ a vector giving the relative widths of the boxes
making up the plot.)
ARG(varwidth @@ if LANG(varwidth) is LANG(TRUE), the boxes
are drawn with widths proportional to the square-roots
of the number of observations in the groups.)
ARG(notch @@ if LANG(notch) is LANG(TRUE), a notch is drawn in each
side of the boxes.  If the notches of two plots do not
overlap then the medians are significantly different at the
5 percent level.)
ARG(DOTS @@ Graphical parameters can be passed as arguments to this
function.)
)
VALUE(
This function is invoked for its side effect which is to
draw box plots based on the given summaries.
It is usually called from LANG(boxplot), abut can be invoked
directly.
