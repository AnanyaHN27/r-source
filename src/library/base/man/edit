ARGUMENTS(
ARG(name @@ a named object that you want to edit. If name is missing then the
file specified by LANG(file) is opened for editing.)
ARG(file @@ a string naming the file to write the edited version to.)
ARG(editor @@ a string naming the text editor you want to use.)
)
DESCRIPTION(
LANG(edit) invokes the text editor specified by LANG(editor) with the object
LANG(name) to be edited. 
LANG(data.entry) can be used to edit data.
It is important to realize that LANG(edit) does not change
the object called LANG(name).
Instead, a copy of name is made and it is that copy which is changed.
Should you want the changes to apply to the object LANG(name)
you must assign the result of LANG(edit) to LANG(name).
PARA
In the form LANG(edit(name)),
LANG(edit) deparses LANG(name) into a temporary file and invokes the
editor LANG(editor) on this file. Quiting from the editor causes
LANG(file) to be parsed and that value returned.
Should an error occur in parsing, possibly due to incorrect syntax, no 
value is returned. Calling LANG(edit()), with no arguments, will 
result in the temporary file being reopened for further editing.
)
SEEALSO(
LANG(LINK(data.entry)), LANG(fix).
)
EXAMPLES(
# use xedit on the function mean and assign the changes
mean <- edit(mean, editor="xedit")
BLANK
# use vi on mean and write the result to file mean.out
vi(mean, file="mean.out")
)
