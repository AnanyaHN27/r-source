TITLE(medpolish @@ Median Polish of a Matrix)
USAGE(
medpolish(x, eps=0.01, maxiter=10)
BLANK
plot(medpolish.obj)

ALIAS(plot.medpolish)
ALIAS(print.medpolish)
DESCRIPTION(
LANG(medpolish) fits an additive
constant-plus-rows-plus-columns
model to the values given in LANG(x) using
Tukey's ITALIC(median polish) procedure.
PARA
Sweeping out for row and column effects continues
until the proportional reduction in the sum
of absolute residuals is less than LANG(eps)
or until the have been LANG(maxiter) iterations.
The sum of absolute residuals is printed at
each iteration of the fitting process.
PARA
The value returned by LANG(medpolish) is an
object of class LANG(medpolish).
Printing and plotting methods are defined for this
class, and can be invoked via the generic functions
LANG(print) and LANG(plot).
)
VALUES(
An object of class LANG(medpolish)
with the following named components:
@@
ARG(overall @@ the fitted constant term.)
ARG(row @@ the fitted row effects.)
ARG(col @@ the fitted column effects.)
ARG(residuals @@ the residuals.)
ARG(name @@ the name of the dataset.)
)
