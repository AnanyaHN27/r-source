TITLE(dist @@ Distance Matrix Computation)
USAGE(
dist(x, method="euclidian", diag=FALSE)
BLANK
print.dist(dist.obj)
)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(x @@ a matrix or (data frame).  Distances between
the rows of LANG(x) will be computed.)
ARG(method @@ the distance measure to be used.
This must be one of LANG("euclidian"), LANG("maximum"),
LANG("manhattan") or LANG("canberra").
Any unambiguous substring can be given.)
ARG(diag @@ a logical value indicating whether the diagonal
of the distance matrix should be included in the result.)
)
DESCRIPTION(
This function computes and returns the distance matrix
computed by using the specified distance measure to
compute the distances between the rows of LANG(x).
)
VALUE(
The lower triangle of the distance matrix (with or without
its diagonal as specified by LANG(diag)) and
stored by columns in a single vector.
The vector has the attributes LANG("size"),
LANG("diag"), LANG("labels") and LANG(class) equal to "dist".
