All good things come from Luke.  This code, from Luke Tierney.  One
minor modification for R by Mike Meyer.


This is a minimal implementation of the ELF-style shared library
access routines dlopen, dlclose, dlsym and dlerror. Also included is a
simple version of gettxt, which is not in HP-UX A.09.05 at least.
These seem adequate to get S up and running. You need to make the
library and install it and the include file someplace appropriate and
modify the S setup script for hp accordingly. Currently the SETUP.hp
script assumes the library and include file live in the directory
$SHOME/hpdl.

Also included is vsystem(), a vfork-based replacement for system().
